=head1 Incompatibilities

Perl 5.26 is not binary compatible with Perl 5.24 and earlier releases.  In particular, do not
attempt to use extensions or PPM packages built for ActivePerl 2400 and older
series builds with ActivePerl 2600 series builds and vice versa.  Please
check L<perl5260delta/Incompatible Changes> for known source level
incompatibilities between the Perl 5.26 releases and the earlier release
series.

=head1 Known Issues

=head2 PPM

There are some known outstanding issues with the PPM 4 client:

=over 3

=item *

The PPM state database (containing configuration information for
repositories, view options in the GUI, and repository state) is not
imported from previous installations.

If you have added custom PPM 4 repositories in previous ActivePerl releases
then you should reconfigure them manually with C<ppm repo add ...> or in the
GUI.  The repository state will be automatically re-synchronized when
PPM is run.

=item *

Post install scripts for packages installed from the GUI will not be able to
receive non-default answers for any prompts it might produce.  Packages that
need non-default answers must be installed with the command line version
of ppm.

=item *

List icons will sometimes not repaint properly after scrolling under
X11.  This does not affect the Windows and Mac OS X builds.

=back

=head2 Mac OS X

=over 3

=item *

Perl library paths, and thus PPM Areas, defined in the shell by the
PERL5LIB environment variable are not available to PPM when it is
launched by clicking the PPM icon in OS X. To to make this variable
available in the OS X GUI, add an entry similar to the following to
F<~/.MacOSX/environment.plist>:

 <key>PERL5LIB</key>
 <string>/path/to/perl/lib</string>

=item *

Running C<sudo ppm> or C<sudo ppm gui> does not start up the GUI with
I<root> privileges.  Use C<ppm> as a command line tool with C<sudo>.

=back

=head2 Windows

=over 3

=item *

The fork() emulation has known limitations.  See L<perlfork> for a
detailed summary.  In particular, fork() emulation will not work
correctly with extensions that are either not thread-safe, or maintain
internal state that cannot be cloned in the pseudo-child process.  This
caveat currently applies to extensions such as Tk and Storable.

=item *

It is possible to install different major versions at the
same time as long as you are careful to use different directories. Do not install
a newer major version of ActivePerl on top of an older version. It is best to uninstall
any older versions and then install this one.

=item *

5.26.x minor version updates can be installed seamlessly on top of an existing 5.26.0 (or later) version.
The installer will first remove files from the old version and then install the new version.
If you changed the default installation directory, you will need to select a custom install and
then choose the directory containing the previous 5.26.x version.

=item *

When upgrading, it can be helpful to save the list of installed PPM modules so they
can be quickly reinstalled for 5.26. From a command-line, run:

 C:\> ppm profile save my-modules.xml

After installing the newer version, use the my-modules.xml file to reinstall the
modules:

 C:\> ppm profile restore my-modules.xml

For future minor versions (5.26.1, etc.), the installer will be able
to upgrade the current version without requiring an uninstall.

If you have any problems with the new installer, you can install from the zip file
version. Remember to run the Installer.bat file included with the zip.

=head2 Further Information

The Perl distribution comes with extensive documentation.  On Unix platforms,
all the standard documentation is installed as man pages under the Perl
install location.  The location of the man pages may need to be added to the
MANPATH environment variable in order to access them.  For example, in
the C shell:

    % setenv MANPATH /opt/ActivePerl-5.26/man:$MANPATH

The documentation is installed in HTML format on all platforms. If ActivePerl
was installed in F</opt/ActivePerl-5.26> then the HTML documentation
would be located in F</opt/ActivePerl-5.26/html>.

On Windows, the standard documentation along with Windows-specific Perl
documentation is installed in HTML format, and is accessible from the
"Start" menu.

Updated versions of the HTML documentation will always be available at
the ActiveState website:

    http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl

=head1 Reporting Problems

Please report any bugs you encounter with this release in the ActiveState bug
database:

    http://bugs.activestate.com

If you do not have web access, reports can be also sent via email to
ActivePerl-Bugs@ActiveState.com.  Please be sure to include detailed
information about the platform in your message.

As far as possible, please ensure that there is enough information in
the report to reproduce the bug elsewhere.  It also helps to submit a
minimal test case that exhibits the bug.

=head1 ActivePerl Community Edition Support Policy

The two most recent stable releases are available for free
download. This corresponds to the Perl community's own version support
policy.

Whenever the underlying Perl version becomes "unsupported" by the Perl
community itself, support for the corresponding ActivePerl versions
will be limited to Business Edition and Enterprise Edition customers.

You can continue to use older ActivePerl releases indefinitely under
the terms of the Community Edition license, but won't be able to
download the installers from ActiveState.

The PPM repositories for unsupported ActivePerl releases will remain
freely accessible for at least 6 months after support ends, but will
no longer be updated with new builds from CPAN.
