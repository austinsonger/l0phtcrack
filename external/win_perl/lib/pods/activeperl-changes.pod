The 2600 series builds of ActivePerl are not binary compatible with
builds in the 2400 or earlier series.  Any extensions built using binaries
from the ActivePerl 2400 or earlier series will need to be recompiled.
Note especially that this applies to PPM packages that may have been
built for earlier series of ActivePerl.
